# Palindrome Checker in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Overview 🔍

**Hey there, I’m Ashraful Alam from Chittagong, Bangladesh!**  
I am a passionate software developer. This is a **Palindrome Checker** app created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It allows users to check if a given word or phrase is a palindrome, i.e., it reads the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

You can input any word or phrase, and the app will tell you whether it’s a palindrome or not. I’ve built this app with a clean and minimalistic design for a better user experience.

Feel free to explore the project and share your feedback!
